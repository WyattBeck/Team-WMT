# Team WT - Update 2/23
Now that we have decided to do the interview dress program it should probably be laid out in the following ways:
1. Ask User for job type
2. Ask user for interview type
3. Ask user for budget

Based on answers:
 - Choose outfit catagory
 - Print Recommendation

We can add in GUI later but that seems to be the basic format in my head.  We can give the users options of jobs types such as Tech, Office, Retail, Trades, or Creative.  And then move on to interview types such as In Person, Video/Zoom, or Phone.  Lastely we would need to set budget levels like 0, Under 50, 50-100, and 150+.

Talked about what roles each of us will work on. I (Tyler Boyajian) am going to working on our code, while Wyatt is doing graphical research to show our clothing suggestions to the user. These suggests should help the user find an affordable, yet reliable, outfit for interviews and/or work.

Side note - Also talked about whether or not to include a question about gender identity, but ultimately decided against it as we dont want to potentially offend anyone. Both of us felt like it was a good thought to include, just not for this type of project.
