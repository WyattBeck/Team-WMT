# Team WT - Update 2/23
Now that we have decided to do the interview dress program it should probably be laid out in the following ways:
1. Ask User for job type
2. Ask user for interview type
3. Ask user for budget

Based on answers:
 - Choose outfit catagory
 - Print Recommendation

We can add in GUI later but that seems to be the basic format in my head.  We can give the users options of jobs types such as Tech, Office, Retail, Trades, or Creative.  And then move on to interview types such as In Person, Video/Zoom, or Phone.  Lastely we would need to set budget levels like 0, Under 50, 50-100, and 150+.
