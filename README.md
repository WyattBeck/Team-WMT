# Update 2/23 - Now that we have decided to do the interview dress program it should probably be laid out in the following way: 
Ask User for job type
Ask user for interview type
Ask user for budget
Based on answers:
  Choose outfit catagory
  Print Recommendation
We can add in GUI later but that seems to be the basic format in my head.  We can give the users options of jobs types such as Tech, Office, Retail, Trades, or Creative.  And then move on to interview types such as In Person, Video/Zoom, or Phone.  Lastely we would need to set budget levels like 0, Under 50, 50-100, and 150+.


-**job interview practice tool** for first generation, neurodivergent, unfamiliar with interviews lets user practice answers

-**random opportunities in area**, where they are in the world ex) New Orleans: How good are you at playing music? skills matcherish

-**dressing to impress: interviews**, helping idividuals decide on interview wear, what would be best to wear for the job
